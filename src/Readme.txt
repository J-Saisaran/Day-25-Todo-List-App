Todo List App
This is a simple yet functional Todo List application built with React.js. The app allows users to manage their tasks efficiently with the ability to create, edit, delete, and filter todos based on their completion status. The application ensures that your tasks are preserved even after refreshing the page.

Features
Add New Todo: Create a new task by providing a task name and description. Each new task is marked as "Not Completed" by default.
Edit Todo: Modify the details of an existing task, including its name, description, and status.
Delete Todo: Remove tasks that are no longer needed.
Update Task Status: Toggle between "Completed" and "Not Completed" status using a dropdown menu.
Filter Todos: View tasks based on their completion status (All, Completed, or Not Completed).
Persistent Storage: All todos are saved in the browser's local storage to ensure data persistence even after page refreshes.
